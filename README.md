# LearningC
All my execises while learning C and C++

I am resuming my learning of programming and I decided to go back to the C and C++ languages. Which I can then use for things like Arduino in the future. 

The book I use is Deitel and Deitel from a little old version. But, it will serve to start this path again. 

Feel free to comment on the codes I upload, in the end it can be a shared learning path.
